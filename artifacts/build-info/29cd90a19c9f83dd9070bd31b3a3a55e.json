@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract.

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.
