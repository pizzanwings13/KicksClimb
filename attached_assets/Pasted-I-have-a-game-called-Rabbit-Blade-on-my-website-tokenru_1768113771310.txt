I have a game called "Rabbit Blade" on my website tokenrush.io.  
It is a Fruit Ninja-style slicing game (swipe to slice flying objects, score points, avoid bombs/misses, etc.).

Current situation:  
- The game is playable but uses a default/small canvas size  
- Background is plain or simple  
- Animations and slicing effects are basic or already similar to Fruit Ninja

I want these exact updates:

1. Make the game FULL SCREEN  
   - Canvas should take up the entire browser viewport (100vw × 100vh)  
   - No borders, no margins, no visible page scrollbars  
   - Game should resize automatically if player rotates device or resizes window  
   - Keep touch/mouse controls responsive across mobile and desktop

2. Change the background to the Rabbit Blade logo  
   - Use the official Rabbit Blade logo as a centered, semi-transparent background image  
   - Make the logo large but subtle (opacity around 0.15–0.3 so it doesn't distract from gameplay)  
   - Darken or blur the background slightly if needed so flying objects and slices remain clearly visible  
   - Keep the gameplay area fully visible over the logo

3. Keep ALL current gameplay mechanics, animations, and effects exactly the same  
   - Same flying object patterns, physics, slicing detection, combo system, scoring  
   - Same particle effects, juice/splash animations, slice trails, sound effects when slicing fruits  
   - Same bomb/miss penalties, game over screen, start/restart flow

4. Overall goals:  
   - Make Rabbit Blade feel like a premium, polished version of Fruit Ninja  
   - Full immersive experience (full screen + branded background)  
   - No change to core fun gameplay loop  
   - Still mobile-friendly (touch swipes work perfectly)  
   - Clean, minimal UI elements (score, combo, lives/misses) stay visible and readable

Implement these changes only. Do not add new game modes, power-ups, new objects, or other features unless explicitly listed.

Focus first on:  
- Making the canvas full-screen and responsive  
- Adding the Rabbit Blade logo as semi-transparent centered background  
- Ensuring slicing animations, particles, and effects remain perfectly intact

Assume the game is built with HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript (possibly with libraries like Konva, PixiJS, or plain canvas).  
Adapt the code to whatever my current setup is.
