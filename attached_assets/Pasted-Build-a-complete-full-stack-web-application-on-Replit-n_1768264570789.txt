Build a complete full-stack web application on Replit named DashvilleMissions using Node.js, Express.js, a simple frontend (EJS templates or basic HTML/CSS/JS), and MongoDB Atlas.

Project goal: Missions/engagement system for Dashville gaming community. Users complete X (Twitter) social missions by tagging @DashKidsnft and @rabbitsonape + posting images/videos, earn points, compete on daily/weekly leaderboards. Weekly top 3 get automatic prizes (KICKS tokens on Solana + NFT for 1st) distributed from a prize wallet.

Core features:

- User authentication:
  - Signup/login with username + password (use bcrypt for hashing)
  - JWT for session authentication
  - Each user has a field for their Solana wallet address (they enter it once in profile/settings after login)

- Missions Tab (main protected page after login):
  - 5 fixed weekly missions, reset every Monday 00:00 UTC:
    1. Post a Dashville gameplay screenshot tagging @DashKidsnft and @rabbitsonape
    2. Share a short Dashville gameplay video clip mentioning @DashKidsnft and @rabbitsonape
    3. Post your Dashville high score or achievement screenshot with both tags
    4. Create and post Dashville fan art or meme tagging both accounts
    5. Share a funny Dashville gaming moment (image or video) with the required mentions
  - Each mission = 10 points when completed
  - Users can complete up to 3 missions per calendar day (daily reset at 00:00 UTC)
  - Show: current week dates, list of 5 missions with description + completion status, daily progress (X/3 today), total weekly points

- Proof submission & verification (Option A):
  - "Submit Proof" button for each mission
  - User pastes the direct X post link (https://x.com/username/status/...)
  - Backend uses twitter-api-v2 library with Bearer Token authentication
  - Fetch the tweet using tweet lookup endpoint (/2/tweets/:id)
  - Request these fields/expansions: tweet.fields=entities,created_at,attachments, media.fields=type,url, expansions=attachments.media_keys
  - Validation:
    - Tweet text must contain BOTH @DashKidsnft and @rabbitsonape (case-insensitive)
    - Must have at least one media attachment (photo OR video)
    - Tweet must be from current week
  - If valid and not previously used → award 10 points, mark mission completed for this user/week, update daily count, store tweet ID to prevent duplicates

- Leaderboards:
  - Weekly: top users by total points this week (show top 50)
  - Daily: top users by points earned today (top 20)
  - Update on point awards (or simple refresh/polling)

- Automated Weekly Prize Distribution & Reset:
  - Use node-cron to run check daily around 00:05 UTC
  - When new week is detected:
    - BEFORE reset: get top 3 users by weekly points
    - Send prizes using @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token:
      - 1st place: 20,000 KICKS tokens + 1 NFT transfer
      - 2nd place: 15,000 KICKS tokens
      - 3rd place: 10,000 KICKS tokens
    - Load prize wallet from PRIVATE_KEY (base58) in env
    - Use the existing KICKS mint address, NFT mint address, and Solana RPC from environment variables
    - Send & confirm transactions, log signatures, handle basic errors
  - AFTER prizes: reset all users' weekly points, completed missions, daily counters, update week start date

Technical requirements:
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB Atlas + mongoose
- Schemas: User (username, passwordHash, solanaWalletAddress), WeeklyProgress (userId, weekStart, points, completedMissions array, submittedTweetIds array, lastDailyDate, dailyCount)
- Dependencies: express, mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, twitter-api-v2, @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-token, node-cron, dotenv
- Use .env / Replit Secrets for: MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN, SOLANA_RPC, PRIZE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY, KICKS_MINT_ADDRESS, NFT_MINT_ADDRESS
- Add basic rate limiting on proof submissions
- Include comments in code, especially around prize sending security
- Make the frontend simple but functional (mission list, submit form, leaderboards table)
- After build, provide instructions for setting up env variables and running the app
