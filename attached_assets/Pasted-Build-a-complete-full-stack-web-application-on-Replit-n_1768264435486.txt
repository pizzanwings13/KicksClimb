Build a complete full-stack web application on Replit named DashvilleMissions using Node.js, Express.js, EJS (or basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend), and MongoDB Atlas.

Project goal: A missions/engagement system for the Dashville gaming community. Users complete social missions on X (Twitter), earn points, appear on daily/weekly leaderboards, and top 3 weekly winners get automatic KICKS token prizes on Solana + NFT for 1st place.

Core features:

- User authentication:
  - Simple signup/login with username + password (bcrypt hashing)
  - JWT for session auth
  - Each user has a Solana wallet address field (they input it once in profile/settings after signup/login)

- Missions Tab (protected route after login):
  - 5 fixed weekly missions that reset every Monday 00:00 UTC:
    1. Post a Dashville gameplay screenshot tagging @dashkids and @rabbitsonape
    2. Share a short Dashville gameplay video clip mentioning @dashkids and @rabbitsonape
    3. Post your Dashville high score or achievement screenshot with both tags
    4. Create and post Dashville fan art or meme tagging both accounts
    5. Share a funny Dashville gaming moment (image or video) with the required mentions
  - Each completed mission = 10 points
  - Limit: max 3 missions per calendar day (daily reset at 00:00 UTC)
  - Weekly max effectively 30 points (but users can complete all 5 across days)
  - UI shows: current week range, list of 5 missions with description + status (pending/completed), daily progress (X/3 today), total weekly points

- Mission completion proof (Option A - semi-automatic verification):
  - "Submit Proof" button per mission
  - User pastes direct X post URL (https://x.com/username/status/...)
  - Backend uses twitter-api-v2 npm package with Bearer Token auth
  - Fetch tweet via /2/tweets/:id endpoint with expansions=attachments.media_keys, tweet.fields=entities,created_at,attachments, media.fields=type,url
  - Validation rules:
    - Tweet text must contain BOTH @dashkids and @rabbitsonape (case-insensitive)
    - Must have at least 1 media item (photo OR video)
    - Tweet timestamp must be within current week
  - If valid & not previously submitted → award 10 points, mark that mission completed for user this week, increment daily count
  - Prevent duplicates: store submitted tweet IDs per user/week

- Leaderboards:
  - Weekly leaderboard: top 50 by total points this week
  - Daily leaderboard: top 20 by points earned today
  - Real-time-ish updates (recalculate on point award or via simple polling/refresh button)

- Automated Weekly Prizes & Reset:
  - Use node-cron to check daily at ~00:05 UTC
  - If new week detected → BEFORE reset:
    - Get top 3 users by weekly points
    - Send prizes using @solana/web3.js + @solana/spl-token:
      - 1st place: 20,000 KICKS SPL token + 1 pre-minted NFT transfer
      - 2nd: 15,000 KICKS
      - 3rd: 10,000 KICKS
    - Prize wallet loaded from PRIVATE_KEY (base58) in .env — use Connection to mainnet (or devnet for testing!)
    - KICKS mint address: YpxLFM4koHT6EvsB1j7ABAAFdqnQpHiJoWzmEiFKick (placeholder — update!)
    - For NFT: assume you have a fixed NFT mint address + associated token account in prize wallet; transfer via createTransferCheckedInstruction or similar
    - Log transaction signatures
    - Handle errors gracefully (e.g. insufficient balance → skip & notify admin)
  - AFTER prizes: reset ALL users' weekly points, completed missions, set new week_start date

Tech & setup requirements:
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB Atlas + mongoose ODM
- Schemas: User (username, passwordHash, solanaWalletAddress), WeeklyProgress (userId, weekStartISO, points, completedMissions: [missionId or name], submittedTweets: [tweetId], lastDailyDate, dailyCount)
- Dependencies: express, mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, twitter-api-v2, @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-token, node-cron, dotenv, cors (if needed)
- .env secrets (use Replit Secrets):
  MONGODB_URI
  JWT_SECRET
  TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN          # from developer.twitter.com app (Basic tier or higher)
  SOLANA_RPC=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com   # or devnet for testing
  PRIZE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY      # base58 encoded — NEVER expose!
  KICKS_MINT_ADDRESS=YpxLFM4koHT6EvsB1j7ABAAFdqnQpHiJoWzmEiFKick
  NFT_MINT_ADDRESS=your_nft_mint_pubkey_here   # pre-minted NFT for 1st place
- Add rate limiting on proof submission (express-rate-limit)
- Basic error logging & user feedback
- Frontend: simple EJS templates or vanilla JS + fetch API calls to backend endpoints
- Make app secure, commented, and include README instructions for setup

Security warnings in code comments: 
- Prize wallet private key MUST be in Replit Secrets only — never in git
- Start with Solana devnet RPC for testing prizes!
- Fund prize wallet with enough SOL (fees) + KICKS tokens + NFT(s)

Build the full app now, then show setup instructions for .env and running it.
